Use shiny app instead?

outcome = data_map %>% distinct(outcome) %>% pull()

 #select incident outcome
                     selectInput("outcome_choice",
                                 label = h3("Choose incident outcome"),
                                 choices = as.list(outcome),
                                 selected = "murder")
                                 
                                  df2 = reactive({
                 x = df1()
                 x = subset(x, outcome == input$outcome_choice)
             })
