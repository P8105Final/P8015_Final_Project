From the plot, we can easy see **male** are the majority of perpetrator. Male are generally considered to be more combative.

### 2010-2020 total shooting incident by perpetrator’s race

       title = "Shooting Incident Trend By Perpetrator’s Race"
       )

Most of perpetrator are **black**, then is white hispanic, black hispanic, white and asian/pacific islander.

       title = "Shooting Incident Trend By Perpetrator’s Age Group"
       )
  
perp_age_plot
```
From 2010 to 2015, the majority of perpetrator are age **18-24**, then is 25-44. However, in recent 5 years(2016-2020), most of perpetrator are age **25-44**. We are wondering maybe this is because some education program or some law about college student.

**brooklyn** has most shooting incident, then is bronx. Staten island has least shooting incident since it dose not have much population

overall, all borough show increase.  in 2015, brooklyn that has most shooting incident boro has a notability increase slope.
